# Vetrra License (Proprietary)

This license governs the proprietary portions of Vetrra. Open-source components bundled with Vetrra (if any) remain licensed under their original licenses.

- Vetrra is proprietary software, provided under subscription terms.
- You may not redistribute, resell, or reverse-engineer Vetrra.
- Some bundled third-party components (for example, HandBrakeCLI) may be open source and are covered by their own licenses.

## 1. Definitions

- **"Vetrra"**: the Vetrra application, installers, updates, and related materials provided by the Licensor.
- **"Licensor"**: Charles Olowookere d/b/a Vetrra Systems.
- **"d/b/a"**: "doing business as" (a trade name used by the Licensor; not a separate legal entity).
- **"You"**: the individual or entity using Vetrra.
- **"Subscription"**: a paid (or otherwise granted) right to use Vetrra for a limited term (monthly or yearly).
- **"Third-Party Components"**: software not authored by the Licensor that is distributed with or used by Vetrra, and which may be governed by separate license terms.

## 2. Ownership

Vetrra is licensed, not sold. Vetrra and all related intellectual property are owned by the Licensor and are protected by applicable copyright and other laws.

## 3. License Grant

Subject to continuous compliance with these terms and an active Subscription, the Licensor grants You a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use Vetrra for Your own internal/personal use.

## 4. Subscription Terms

- Vetrra is offered as a subscription (monthly or yearly; single tier).
- Your right to use Vetrra ends when Your Subscription ends, unless renewed.
- You may not share license keys, activation credentials, or accounts outside Your permitted use.

## 5. Restrictions

You may not (and may not allow others to):

- Copy, redistribute, publish, sell, sublicense, rent, lease, or lend Vetrra
- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code, except where prohibited by law
- Bypass or disable licensing/activation, rate limits, or other technical restrictions
- Use Vetrra to violate any law or third-party rights

## 6. Updates and Changes

Vetrra may be updated from time to time. Updates may add, change, or remove features. The Licensor may change pricing, subscription terms, or availability with reasonable notice where required by law.

## 7. Third-Party Services and Tools

Vetrra may integrate with or depend on third-party products and services (for example: Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, SABnzbd, TMDb/TVDB/Fanart, Docker/NVIDIA NIM, or similar). Those third parties have their own terms and privacy policies, and You are responsible for complying with them.

Vetrra may also rely on external tools you install separately (for example: FFmpeg, MKVToolNix, Subtitle Edit, Ollama). Those tools are licensed by their respective owners.

## 8. Third-Party Components and Open-Source Notices

Some Vetrra distributions may include Third-Party Components. If a Third-Party Component is distributed under an open-source license, that license applies to the Third-Party Component (not to the proprietary portions of Vetrra).

### 8.1. Example: HandBrakeCLI (GPL)

If your Vetrra distribution includes HandBrakeCLI, HandBrakeCLI is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). A copy of the GPL license text is provided in `docs/licenses/`.

### 8.2. Source Code Availability / Written Offer

To the extent required by applicable open-source licenses (including the GPL), the Licensor will provide the corresponding source code for any open-source components distributed with Vetrra upon request for at least three (3) years after the date the component is distributed.

If you need the exact corresponding source for a specific build you received, include the Vetrra version and the component name/version in your request.

## 9. Privacy and Local Diagnostics

Vetrra is designed to run locally on your machine. It writes configuration and logs to your Windows profile (for example, `%APPDATA%\\Vetrra\\config\\config.ini` and `%APPDATA%\\Vetrra\\logs`).

Unless you explicitly choose to share logs with support, Vetrra does not require you to upload your logs, file paths, media titles, or API keys to the Licensor for basic operation.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Licensor will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from Your use of (or inability to use) Vetrra.

## 12. Termination

This license terminates automatically if You breach these terms. Upon termination, You must stop using Vetrra and delete all copies in Your possession or control.
